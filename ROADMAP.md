# TIL roadmap

- Java
- Kotlin (differences with Java)
- Rust (pros and cons over C languages, memory)
- C / C++ / C# (write about differences, etc.)
- Golang (special things, goroutines their weight, etc.)
- Haskell, functional programming?
- Computer science (binary to decimal formulas, etc.)
- Gather information about what actually happens when you take a picture. From a computer science perspective. Formats, codecs, etc.
- Clouds, architectures (Soap, etc.)
- Diagrams (TLA+, UML, etc.), software. Diagrams as a code.
- How to write wiki.

Consider using monorepo style? Or maybe a GitHub team :thinking:
